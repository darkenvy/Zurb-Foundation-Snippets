Zurb-Foundation-Snippets
========================

A collection of Sublime Text snippets for Zurb Foundation. I will start with adding snippets for Foundation 4, but will eventually add Foundation 3.

Snippets will start with "f4-" then will be invoked with a descriptive (and if possible condenced) keyword. Snippets listed below:
